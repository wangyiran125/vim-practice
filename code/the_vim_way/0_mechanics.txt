The x command deletes the character under the cursor. When we use the dot
command in this context, ¡°repeat last change¡± tells Vim to delete the character
under the cursor

The dd command also performs a deletion, but this one acts on the current line as a
whole. If we use the dot command after dd, then ¡°repeat last change¡± instructs Vim
to delete the current line:

Finally, the >G command increases the indentation from the current line until the end
of the file. If we follow this command with the dot command, then ¡°repeat last
change¡± tells Vim to increase the indentation level from the current position to the
end of the file. In this example, we¡¯ll start with the cursor on the second line to
highlight the difference


Line one
Line two
Line three
Line four
