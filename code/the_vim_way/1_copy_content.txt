The j command moves the cursor
down one line, and then the $ command moves it to the end of the line. We¡¯ve used
two keystrokes just to maneuver our cursor into position so that we can use the dot
command.

the A command
appends at the end of the current line
In other words, it squashes $a into a single keystroke

Now we can repeat the change on
consecutive lines just by typing j. as many times as it takes.

Suppose that we want to use the word ¡°copy¡± (as in ¡°copywriting¡±) instead of
¡°content.¡±
:%s/content/copy/g

Having executed a search for the word ¡°content,¡± we can now advance to the next
occurrence just by hitting the n key. In this case, pressing *nn would cycle through
all matches
