From Normal mode, we can engage Replace mode with the R command. As the
example demonstrates, typing ¡°, b¡± overwrites the existing ¡°. B¡± characters. And
when we¡¯re finished with Replace mode, we can hit the <Esc> key to return to
Normal mode.

Typing in Insert mode extends the line. But in Replace mode
the line length doesn't change.
